# Overhaul plan: automating Berichtspilot

## Vision

Today: type activities from time tracking and WebUntis → app formats → copy three
blocks into the IHK portal.

Goal: **dictate a few sentences per day (customer details left out while
speaking), school topics come from WebUntis automatically, an AI turns the notes
into clean bullets** — the user only reviews and copies.

```
dictation (local, bundled model) ─┐
                                   ├─► raw notes per day ─► AI phrasing ─► week (as today) ─► copy to IHK
WebUntis "Lehrstoff" ─────────────┘    (daten.json)         (E-011)        editable, exact     (portal automation
                                                                            output format        deferred, E-012)
```

## Guardrails

- "Easy to use": installer → works. No mandatory extra software (E-006).
- Local first; network only in the main process + allowlist (E-007).
- Nothing leaves the machine without the user seeing it (E-009 – E-011).
- Without network/accounts everything works like v1.2 (every automation is optional).
- Output format and `daten.json` safety stay untouched.

## Next step

**Phase 5 — auto-update (electron-updater + GitHub Releases).** The Friday
reminder was dropped by the user (2026-10-10). Ask the open questions below
first, then split the step:

- **5.1 Decision + release plumbing:** entry E-017 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
  (behaviour, hosts, which builds update). `package.json` → `build.publish`
  (`provider: github`, owner `Rexi255`, repo `berichtspilot`) so electron-builder
  writes `latest.yml` / `latest-linux.yml` (+ `.blockmap`);
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` must attach those files to the release too.
  New allowlist rows in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (`github.com`,
  `api.github.com` if used, the release-asset download host — check which host
  the redirect really goes to before listing it).
- **5.2 Main process:** `electron/updater.js` — `autoUpdater` with
  `autoDownload` per the user's answer, only for the NSIS install and the
  AppImage (`process.env.PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR` set ⇒ portable ⇒ only "new
  version available" + link, no self-update); dev mode never checks. IPC
  `update:status|check|download|install` in `preload.js`; German error texts
  like `electron/net.js`. Vitest for the pure parts (version compare /
  portable detection helper if any).
- **5.3 UI:** quiet hint (toast or sidebar badge) "Update auf vX.Y.Z
  verfügbar" → button per the chosen behaviour; Settings → "Verhalten" or a new
  "Über/Updates" row with the current version and "Nach Updates suchen".
- Verify: lint/test/build; a real update test needs two tagged releases — plan
  it with the user (e.g. a `v1.2.1-beta` pre-release) instead of guessing.

## Open questions (for the user)

- Auto-update behaviour? Options: (a) check on start, show "Update
  verfügbar" — download + restart only after a click (recommended: nothing
  happens behind the user's back, fits the "visible and confirmed" rule);
  (b) download silently in the background, install when the app is closed;
  (c) only show "new version available" with a link to the release page (no
  self-update at all). Ask at the start of the next step.
- Portable .exe can't update itself — is a hint with a download link enough
  there (recommended), or should the portable build be dropped?

Parked by the user (2026-10-10), not to be asked now: which speech model to
bundle (E-010 has the measurements; real-voice recordings belong to that
decision).

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 — AI groundwork
- [x] Repo structure for AI work: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/` knowledge base, skills,
      SessionStart hook (2026-10-09)
- [x] Docs, AI instructions and skills switched to English; glossary (2026-10-10)

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- [x] 1.1 English identifiers + `daten.json` fields, schema v3 with migration + tests (2026-10-10)
- [x] 1.2 Schema v4: `notes` (raw text) per day + collapsible "Notizen" field, searchable (2026-10-10)

### Phase 2 — Dictation (offline, model bundled — E-010) · on hold (model choice parked by the user)
- [x] 2.1 Notes → bullets without AI (pure `splitNotes()` + button) (2026-10-10)
- [x] 2.2 Spike: whisper.cpp CLI with whisper base/small/large-v3-turbo and
      parakeet v3 measured → E-010 (2026-10-10); model choice parked
- [ ] 2.3 Microphone: `setPermissionRequestHandler` grants only `media` to the app window
- [ ] 2.4 Transcription in a utility process/worker, IPC `speech:transcribe`
- [ ] 2.5 UI: dictate button in the notes area (recording state, level meter, cancel) → `notes`

### Phase 3 — AI phrasing (E-011)
- [x] 3.1 User picked option A, the clipboard bridge → E-011 accepted (2026-10-10)
- [x] 3.2 Pure lib `src/lib/phrasing.js`: prompt with style rules + the user's own
      bullets as examples, tolerant answer parser; tests (2026-10-10)
- [x] 3.3 Safety check before copying: warns about e-mail/IP/MAC/ticket/phone
      patterns (2026-10-10)
- [x] 3.4 Clipboard bridge UI ("Mit KI formulieren"): copy prompt → paste answer →
      preview per day → apply, undoable (2026-10-10)
- [x] ~~3.5 School days: polish topic keywords per subject~~ — dropped by the user
      (2026-10-10): the raw "Lehrstoff" texts are good enough

### Phase 4 — WebUntis import (E-013)
- [x] 4.1 Spike with the real account: probe `npm run probe:webuntis` +
      anonymiser `electron/shape.js`; W1 works, endpoints for week + lesson
      topics found, W2 (QR code) available → E-013 accepted (2026-10-10)
- [x] 4.2 Network layer in main: `electron/net.js` — `fetch` wrapper with host
      allowlist, timeout, readable errors; Vitest for the allowlist (2026-10-10)
- [x] 4.3 Session handling: `electron/webuntis-session.js` (login window in
      partition `persist:webuntis`, token cache with renewal, status, logout) +
      `electron/jwt.js`; IPC `webuntis:status|login|logout` (2026-10-10)
- [x] 4.4 Settings → new section "Verbindungen": WebUntis on/off (schema v5
      `settings.webuntis.enabled`), school read-only, status, login/logout (2026-10-10)
- [x] 4.5a `electron/webuntis.js` week fetch (timetable + "Lehrstoff" per block) + pure
      normaliser `schoolDaysFromWebuntis()`; IPC `webuntis:week` (2026-10-10, real account checked)
- [x] 4.5b Mapping WebUntis subject → profile label: `mapSubjects()` (auto by short/long
      name, case/leading zeros ignored), schema v6 `profile.webuntisSubjects`, list in
      Profiles → "WebUntis-Fächer" (2026-10-10)
- [x] 4.6 "Woche aus WebUntis füllen": school days + subjects + topics from lesson
      topics ("Lehrstoff" = `teachingContent`); detect breaks/cancelled lessons
  - [x] 4.6a pure merge logic `fillWeekFromWebuntis()` (only fills empty subjects of
        normal school days, appends missing ones, reports the rest) (2026-10-10)
  - [x] 4.6b UI: `src/views/WebuntisPanel.jsx` — preview per day with untick/assign,
        login retry, apply + undo (2026-10-10; real account checked by the user)

### Phase 5 — Comfort
- [ ] Auto-update (electron-updater, GitHub Releases)
- [x] ~~Friday reminder if the current week is still a draft~~ — dropped by the
      user (2026-10-10): neither an in-app hint nor a system notification
- [x] Create the current week automatically on start — Mon–Fri only (E-016),
      schema v7 `settings.autoCreateWeek`, switch in Settings → Verhalten (2026-10-10)
- [ ] Ideas from the old README roadmap: light theme, "copy all 3 blocks",
      full export/PDF, copy a single day from the previous week, character counter
- [ ] Update the README "100 % offline" badge once network features exist

### Later / to-do
- [ ] Automatic entry into the IHK portal (deferred by the user, E-012)
